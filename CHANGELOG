2013-07-10 - Version '0.1.6-dev'

 - Changed default display behavior to be similar to the interactive
   interpreter, except using pprint for non-None.

   Compatibility note: To produce the same output as v0.1.6, use the sh()
   magic variable.  For example replace:

   $ pyeval '"foo"' # version 0.1.6

   -with:

   $ pyeval 'sh("foo")' # versions after 0.1.6:

   For more details run:

   $ pyeval 'help(sh)'

 - Added thorough unittests with full branch coverage.

 - Improved the online help system and added many topics.  To see the
   result, run:

   $ pyeval help

   The examples in online help topics are verified by unittests.

 - Transitioned away from a single "pyeval" script to a separate
   library and script, so that it's possible to use pyeval features in
   other projects.


2012-05-30 - Version '0.1.6' - As of: 573158ff1db2

 - If the standard python encoding is available use that.
 - If not, try to parse LC_CTYPE and use that.
